ðŸ¤Œ

In realms of code, where logic reigns,<br>
A cosmic dance of data sustains,<br>
A symphony of bits and bytes,<br>
Where algorithms take their flights.<br>

In binary's celestial sphere,<br>
Where stars of syntax shine clear,<br>
Astronauts of code embark,<br>
On missions through the digital dark.<br>

Through nebulae of nested loops,<br>
They navigate through syntax hoops,<br>
Unraveling the tangled threads,<br>
Of algorithms, where logic spreads.<br>

With every line of code they write,<br>
They orbit new celestial heights,<br>
Unveiling mysteries of the mind,<br>
Where logic and creativity find.<br>

In code-orbits, worlds unfold,<br>
Where dreams are spun with stories told,<br>
A tapestry of digital art,<br>
Where programmers play their part.<br>

Oh, code-orbit, realm of wonder,<br>
Where innovation knows no thunder,<br>
A cosmic playground, vast and grand,<br>
Where dreams are coded, hand in hand.
