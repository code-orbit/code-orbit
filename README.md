In realms of code, where logic reigns,
A cosmic dance of data sustains,
A symphony of bits and bytes,
Where algorithms take their flights.

 In binary's celestial sphere,
Where stars of syntax shine clear,
Astronauts of code embark,
On missions through the digital dark.

 Through nebulae of nested loops,
They navigate through syntax hoops,
Unraveling the tangled threads,
Of algorithms, where logic spreads.

 With every line of code they write,
They orbit new celestial heights,
Unveiling mysteries of the mind,
Where logic and creativity find.

 In code-orbits, worlds unfold,
Where dreams are spun with stories told,
A tapestry of digital art,
Where programmers play their part.

 Oh, code-orbit, realm of wonder,
Where innovation knows no thunder,
A cosmic playground, vast and grand,
Where dreams are coded, hand in hand.
